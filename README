cuke4php
========

This project implements the cucumber wire protocol for PHP projects.
Information about the wire protocol: http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wire-protocol

Using this protocol it is possible to directly interact with PHP code at any level without the need for a web server.  To accomplish this, when cucumber is running against a directory containing feature files and it cannot resolve a particular step definition, it will ask a known wire server (as defined in a .wire file) to interpret and run those steps.

Dependencies
------------
* Cucumber (see http://cukes.info)
* PHPUnit (see http://www.phpunit.de/)

Goals
-----
This project utilizes PHPUnit because it has a robust set of assertions, has good mocking, and is widely used.  This will facilitate adoption by developers who are already familiar with it.

This project was developed against the 5.2.x versions of PHP, to ensure compatibility with older PHP projects.
